				Programming experience. I was lucky, I found my true passion and what I love doing early in life. My first contact with a programming language was when I was 15, at a rural college in Japan and I’ve never looked back, below is more details on my experiences with programming.

			<p>Once I learned English, I started studying Web Development in Vancouver at VanArts where I dug deep into front-end web technology, design, and creating CMS systems from scratch. I’ve been studying really hard, staying into the wee hours of the night and even weekends to really get a solid understanding of web development. I love tackling new things even if they’re complicated - <strong>Life is a challenge.</strong></p>

			<p>While with TIS I developed ERP/EDI/CRM systems mainly for enterprises, using several languages which I hadn't ever had experience with. I led a small team that produced some parts of features. In the project, I was also taking responsibility of architecting an object-oriented MVC framework for a part of system. I always belonged to projects that were in trouble and my job was to be the firefighter who came in saved them, and then developed them properly.</p>

			<p>This is where I really started learning programming. I learned how to create mathematical algorithms and proof of circular constant, differential/integral equations, FTT etc. in C. Not only that but also object-oriented design, database structure design, numerical analysis and more. I've built an assembler in a class, also built an image converter using k-means clustering.</p>
